# Image Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies images into different categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras, and trained on a popular image dataset.

## Features

- Classifies images into predefined categories
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for high accuracy
- Simple and intuitive web interface for uploading and classifying images

# Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used for development.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the image classifier.
Flask: For the web interface to upload and classify images.
NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation.
OpenCV: For image preprocessing.
